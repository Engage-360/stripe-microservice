### Stripe microservice

Use this microservice to easily integrate Stripe in your apps to make payments without having to use Stripe Checkout or Elements. No token needed, simply pass a Stripe customer id and a few other params and this microservice takes care of charging the customer's credit card through Stripe.

First, visit [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), sign up for an account and get API keys.

#### Quick start

Once equipped with keys, clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/seanrobenalt/stripe-microservice`

And then:

`cd stripe-microservice`

`bundle`

`figaro install` *<-- easy app config using ENV and YAML file*

Figaro generates an `application.yml` file where you will store your Stripe keys like so:

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: `pk_test00000000000`
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: `pk_secret0000000000`
```

This repo comes with the [`stripe.rb`](./config/initializers/stripe.rb) initializer file so you're all set up.

#### Deploying to Heroku

If you don't have an account, visit [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign up for one.

Install Heroku CLI with Homebrew:

`brew install heroku/brew/heroku`

Log in to your account via CLI:

`heroku login`

Create a Heroku app:

`heroku create`

Run this series of commands to ensure Heroku production environment gets set up and your API is ready:

`bundle`

`RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create db:migrate`

`git push heroku master`

`heroku restart`

`heroku run rake db:migrate`

Wait for your app to be deployed and take down the url that Heroku created for you where your app is hosted. You will need this url to POST to from your app.

#### Using the service

A few simple functions in your app will take care of interacting with your Stripe account.

First, set up a namespace to avoid this code colliding with other JavaScript in your app:

```javascript
var stripeService = {};
```

Next, set up a global function for sending the AJAX request:

```javascript
const ajaxify = function(endpoint, payload) {
  var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open("POST", endpoint, true);
  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  request.send(JSON.stringify(payload));
}
```

Then define functions on the `stripeService` object that POST to different routes and send different objects depending on what you want to send to Stripe.

##### Creating a customer

```javascript
const customerEndpoint = 'https://your-heroku-path.herokuapp.com/api/customers';

stripeService.createStripeCustomer = function(data, customerEndpoint) {
  // description not required
  var customer = description: {customer: {
    description: data.description,
    email: data.email,
    exp_month: data.exp_month,
    exp_year: data.exp_year,
    cvc: data.cvc,
    number: data.card_number
  }};

  ajaxify(customerEndpoint, customer);

};
```

##### Making a payment

```javascript
const paymentEndpoint = 'https://your-heroku-path.herokuapp.com/api/payments';

stripeService.hitStripe = function(data, paymentEndpoint) {
  // cus_id, amount and currency are required, description is optional
  var payment = {payment: {
    cus_id: data.cus_id,
    amount: data.amount,
    currency: data.currency,
    description: data.description
  }};

  ajaxify(paymentEndpoint, payment);

};
```

##### Creating coupons

If you want to create coupons for customers along with their payments, do so by including a `coupon` value of `true` in your data. You must also send a  `duration` for the coupon and attach these params to your payments like so:

```javascript
const paymentEndpoint = 'https://your-heroku-path.herokuapp.com/api/payments';

stripeService.hitStripe = function(data, paymentEndpoint) {
  // coupon must be set to true in order for a coupon to be created
  // a coupon duration can be 'once', 'forever' or 'repeating'
  // coupon percent_off must be integer and coupon_id is string of your choice ie. '50OFF'
  var payment = {payment: {
    cus_id: data.cus_id,
    amount: data.amount,
    currency: data.currency,
    description: data.description,
    coupon: data.coupon,
    duration: data.duration,
    percent_off: data.percent_off,
    coupon_id: data.coupon_id
  }};

  ajaxify(paymentEndpoint, payment);

};
```

This method will create a coupon in Stripe with the provided params. It will also send out an email to the Stripe customer with the coupon code, percent off they get with the coupon and how many times they can use the coupon. This does require you to set up a [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account, but this is extremely easy to do with the Heroku CLI:

`heroku addons:create mailgun`

`heroku addons:open mailgun`

This creates an account and opens up your dashboard. Click the `Domains` tab from your Mailgun dashboard. Copy your *Default SMTP Login* and *Default Password* to your `application.yml` file which was generated by figaro and then run:

`figaro heroku:set -e production`

Open up the [`mail.rb`](./config/initializers/mail.rb) included in this repo and change the domain to your deployed Heroku instance. You are all set to send out emails to your customers with Stripe generated coupons upon receiving their payments.

You can also create coupons separate from customer payments:

```javascript
const couponEndpoint = 'https://your-heroku-path.herokuapp.com/api/coupons';

stripeService.createCoupon = function(data, couponEndpoint) {
  // available params on coupon object
  var coupon = {coupon: {
    duration: data.duration,
    percent_off: data.percent_off,
    duration_in_months: data.duration_in_months,
    currency: data.currency,
    amount_off: data.amount_off,
    max_redemptions: data.max_redemptions,
    redeem_by: data.redeem_by
  }};

  ajaxify(couponEndpoint, coupon);

};
```

This creates a coupon for you to use as you wish. Stripe will generate a custom coupon code for your customers to use.

##### Creating plans

```javascript
const planEndpoint = 'https://your-heroku-path.herokuapp.com/api/plans';

stripeService.createPlan = function(data, planEndpoint) {
  // available params on coupon object
  var plan = {plan: {
    currency: data.currency,
    interval: data.interval,
    name: data.name,
    amount: data.amount,
    interval_count: data.interval_count,
    statement_descriptor: data.statement_descriptor
  }};

  ajaxify(planEndpoint, plan);

};
```

##### Creating accounts

```javascript
const accountEndpoint = 'https://your-heroku-path.herokuapp.com/api/accounts';

stripeService.createAccount = function(data, accountEndpoint) {
  // available params on coupon object
  var account = {account: {
    country: data.country,
    email: data.email,
    type: data.account_type
  }};

  ajaxify(accountEndpoint, account);

};
```
